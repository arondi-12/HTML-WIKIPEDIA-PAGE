        <p>Volkswagen R is the brand used by the German auto manufacturer <br> Volkswagen to indicate a sport or high performance model. An "R" badge is <br> placed on the grille, front fenders and trunk of R-model vehicles to indicate <br> the vehicle's trim level.</p>
<p>The R-marque is used on certain performance models alongside "GT" <br> model designations, such as the GTI, GLI, GTE and GTD. These vehicles <br> are also sold as "sport models" but are less performance-oriented when <br> compared to vehicles such as the Golf R.</p>
<h2>Models</h2>
<hr><h2>Golf R32 (Mk4)</h2>
<p> <cite>Main article: Volkswagen Golf Mk4 R32</cite></p>
<p>Volkswagen began production of the Mk4 R32 in 2002, for the 2003 model year. It <br>
    was the world's first production car with a dual-clutch gearbox (DSG) — available for <br>
    the German market.[2] Due to unexpected popularity, Volkswagen decided to sell the <br>
    car in the United States and Australia as the 2004 model year Volkswagen R32. Billed <br>
</p>as the pinnacle of the Golf IV platform, the R32 included every performance, safety, <br>
and luxury feature Volkswagen had to offer, including the all new 3,189 cc (3.2 L; <br>
194.6 cu in) DOHC 4 valves per cylinder VR6 engine (ID codes: BFH/BML), which <br>
produced a rated motive power output of 241 PS (238 bhp; 177 kW) at 6,250 rpm and <br>

320 N⋅m (236 lb⋅ft) at 2,800 rpm of torque.[3] Further additions included Haldex <br>
Traction-based 4motion on-demand four-wheel drive system, a new six-speed manual transmission, independent rear <br>
suspension, Climatronic automatic climate control, sport seats from König with R32 badging, 18" OZ Aristo alloy wheels <br>
(Ronal produced the wheels towards the end of production), Electronic Stability Programme, larger 334 mm (13.1 in) disc <br>
brakes with gloss blue painted calipers, sunroof (for the US), Xenon Headlamps (for Europa), and model-specific <br>
bodywork additions.
<h2>Golf R (Mk7)</h2>
<p><cite>Main article: Volkswagen Golf R</cite></p>
<p>
    Like the GTI, the Golf R is also built as a three- or five-door hatchback. It is powered <br>
    by a newly developed version of the 1,984 cc (2.0 L; 121.1 cu in) turbocharged EA888 <br>
    petrol FSI inline-four engine used in the latest Golf GTI (and Audi S3), but in this <br>
    application producing 300 PS (296 bhp; 221 kW) (206 kW (280 PS; 276 bhp) for "hot <br>
    climate" markets such as Australia, Japan, USA) from 5,500 to 6,200 rpm and <br>
    380 N⋅m (280 lb⋅ft) from 1,800 to 5,500 rpm of torque.[5] Compared to the GTI's <br>
    powerplant, the Golf R's engine has a modified cylinder head, exhaust valves, valve <br>
    <!--Insert image of Golf R (Mk7) embeded on the right of the texts to this point-->
    seats and springs, pistons, injection valves and larger intercooler and turbocharger. DSG equipped models also come <br>
    with an auxiliary oil cooler on the passenger side.
