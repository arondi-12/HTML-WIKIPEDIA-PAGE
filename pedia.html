<p>
    In September 2005, the Mk5 R32 went on sale in Europe. United Kingdom sales <br>
    began in November that year. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_R#cite_note-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> It features an updated 3.2-litre <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VR6_engine">VR6 engine</a> of that <br>
    fitted to the previous Mk4 version, with an extra 10 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_horsepower">PS</a> (7 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt">kW</a>; 10 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower#Brake_horsepower">bhp</a> ) due to a <br>
    eworked inlet manifold. Maximum power is now 250 PS (184 kW; 247 bhp) at <br>
    6,300 rpm; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque">torque</a> is unchanged at 320 N⋅m (236 lbf⋅ft). It reaches an electronically <br>
    governed top speed of 250 km/h (155.3 mph). Going from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) will <br>
    take 6.5 s, reduced to 6.2 s with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-Shift_Gearbox">Direct-Shift Gearbox</a>. 
    Compared with the previous Mk4 R32, it is 0.1 seconds faster for the manual version, <br>

    style="width: 630px; height: 450px;"> <br>
    while the newer R32 is about 40 kg (88.2 lb) heavier. As with the previous R32; there <br>
    is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haldex_Traction">Haldex Traction</a> -based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4motion">4motion</a> part-time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-wheel_drive">four-wheel drive</a>, now through 18" Zolder 20-spoke alloy wheels. <br>

<h2>Golf R (Mk6)</h2>
<p>
    The MK6 Golf R was sold from 2012-2013, and was the first 'R' model to feature a <br>
    turbocharged 2.0L FSI engine and direct injection. The EA113 TFSI engine was brought <br>
    forward from the previous generation MK5 Jetta/GTI/Passat, with some technical changes. <br>
    The EA113 'R' variant produced 257 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_horsepower">PS</a> (189 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt">kW</a>; 253 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower#Brake_horsepower">bhp</a>) and <br>
    330 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-metre">N.m</a> (243 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound-foot_(torque)">Ibf.ft</a> ) with the addition of a K04 turbocharger/exhaust manifold module <br>
    from BorgWarner, larger direct injectors, optimized camshafts, and a larger charge air cooler.

    The MK6 Golf R was offered with both a 6-speed manual transmission as well as a 6- <br>
    speed Direct Shift Gearbox, although only the manual version was offered in North <br>
    America. 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) time was 5.8 seconds, 0.7 seconds faster than the <br>
    curb weight is only 7lbs lighter than the previous generation.
